Currently, I am pursuing a Master’s degree at **Southeast University** supervised by [Jie Gui](https://guijiejie.github.io/index.html) and [Hongsong Wang](https://cse.seu.edu.cn/2022/0908/c23024a419407/page.htm). 
Prior to SEU, I graduated from [Southwest University](www.swu.edu.cn) in June 2024 with a Bachelor. 
I am very grateful to [Hangjun Che](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Che-Hangjun) who introduced me to machine learning.  

My current research centers on **Generative Models**, with a focus on generation and editing tasks across image and 3D domains. I am actively pursuing (1) Ph.D. positions for Fall 2027, and (2) research collaborations on related topics. Feel free to reach out to me at <i class="fas fa-envelope"></i> [xndsb330@email.swu.edu.cn](mailto:xndsb330@email.swu.edu.cn) or <i class="fas fa-envelope"></i> [xinyupu@seu.edu.cn](mailto:xinyupu@seu.edu.cn) if you're interested in discussing research opportunities or collaborations.

For any inquiries concerning my work, please feel free to contact me. I would be happy to hear from you and discuss potential opportunities for collaboration or exchange of ideas.
