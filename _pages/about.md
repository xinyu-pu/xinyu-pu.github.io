Currently, I am pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree at **Southeast University** supervised by [Jie Gui](https://guijiejie.github.io/index.html) and [Hongsong Wang](https://cse.seu.edu.cn/2022/0908/c23024a419407/page.htm). 
Prior to SEU, I graduated from [Southwest University](www.swu.edu.cn) in June 2024 with a Bachelor. 
I am very grateful to [Hangjun Che](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Che-Hangjun) who introduced me to machine learning.  

My current research focuses on **Generative Model**, e.g. image editing and generation. 
My previous research interests lie in **Unsupervised Learning**, e.g. multi-view learning and clustering. 

For any problem concerning my work, please feel free to contact me ([Xinyu Pu-swu](mailto:xndsb330@email.swu.edu.cn), [Xinyu Pu-seu](mailto:xinyupu@seu.edu.cn)).
